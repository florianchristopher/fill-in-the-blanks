# fill-in-the-blanks
For this project, you'll be building a Fill-in-the-Blanks quiz. Your quiz will prompt a user with a paragraph containing several blanks. The user should then be asked to fill in each blank appropriately to complete the paragraph. This can be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary!
